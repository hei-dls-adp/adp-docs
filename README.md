# List of Modules

## [Module 01 Introduction to industrial automation](./ADP_Module_01_Industrial_Automation/README.md). 
This module introduces **I**ndustrial **A**utomation **C**ontrol **S**ystems **IACS** and **PLCs**, explaining their role in controlling devices like conveyors and grippers with fixed cycle times. It covers **IEC 61131-2/9 standards** for hardware and communication interfaces, then explores major **fieldbuses**, e.g. EtherCAT, IO-Link, Modbus RTU, with their latency characteristics: EtherCAT offers sub-millisecond real-time performance, IO-Link provides 2–5 ms point-to-point communication for smart sensors, and Modbus RTU delivers simplicity at the cost of 10–100 ms latency. The choice of fieldbus significantly impacts integration time and project cost. Finally, PLCs are presented as modules executing cyclic code within larger systems that require real-time monitoring without the ability to pause execution.

## Module 02, will be completed soon
